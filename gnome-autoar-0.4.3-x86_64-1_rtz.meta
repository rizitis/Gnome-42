PACKAGE DESCRIPTION:
gnome-autoar: gnome-autoar (Automatic archives creating and extracting library)
gnome-autoar:
gnome-autoar: Creating and extracting archives is easy, safe, and automatic. One
gnome-autoar: module is created (gnome-autoar) and three modules are modified
gnome-autoar: (Epiphany, Evolution, Empathy). The two major steps of this project
gnome-autoar: are:
gnome-autoar:   * An wrapper for libarchive, GIO, and GTK+, provides GObject-based
gnome-autoar:     C API for archives and a few common widgets.
gnome-autoar:   * Integrate archives into applications. I try to use existing
gnome-autoar:     widgets in applications to show archive works and user
gnome-autoar:     preferences settings.
