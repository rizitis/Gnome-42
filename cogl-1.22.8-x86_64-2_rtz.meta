PACKAGE DESCRIPTION:
cogl: cogl (3D graphics API)
cogl:
cogl: Cogl is a small open source library for using 3D graphics hardware for
cogl: rendering. The API departs from the flat state machine style of OpenGL
cogl: and is designed to make it easy to write orthogonal components that
cogl: can render without stepping on each others toes.
cogl:
cogl: Having other backends, besides OpenGL, such as drm, Gallium or D3D are
cogl: options we are interested in for the future.
